Problem Statement: Binary Search

Given:
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 < nums[i], target < 104
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.

Problem Statement: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

Given:
Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

//Medium level : question 2

Problem Statement: Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Given:
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
All values of nums are unique.
nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
-104 <= target <= 104

Problem Statement: Single Element in a Sorted Array

Given:
You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.
Return the single element that appears only once.
Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
0 <= nums[i] <= 105

Problem Statement: Find a Peak Element II

Given:
A peak element in a 2D grid is an element that is strictly greater than all of its adjacent neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.
Given a 0-indexed m x n matrix mat where no two adjacent cells are equal, find any peak element mat[i][j] and return the length 2 array [i,j].
You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an outer perimeter with the value -1 in each cell.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(m log(n)) or O(n log(m)) time.

Example 1:
Input: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Both 3 and 4 are peak elements so [1,0] and [0,1] are both acceptable answers.

Constraints:
m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 500
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 105
No two adjacent cells are equal.

The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.
You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

Problem Statement: Aggressive Cows

Given:
You are given an array 'arr' consisting of 'n' integers which denote the position of a stall.
You are also given an integer 'k' which denotes the number of aggressive cows.
You are given the task of assigning stalls to 'k' cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.
Print the maximum possible minimum distance.

Example:
Input: 'n' = 3, 'k' = 2 and 'arr' = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum possible minimum distance will be 2 when 2 cows are placed at positions {1, 3}. Here distance between cows is 2.

Sample Input 1 :
6 4
0 3 4 7 10 9
Sample Output 1 :
3
Explanation to Sample Input 1 :
The maximum possible minimum distance between any two cows will be 3 when 4 cows are placed at positions {0, 3, 7, 10}. Here distance between cows are 3, 4 and 3 respectively.
